			<p class="parahone">Scientific and historical facts about space,<br>
			galaxies, the planets and other objects in the cosmos<br><br>
			Dont put your seatbelts, because that is all the fun in zero gravity </p><br>
			
			<p>Fact 1<br>It is just a theory!</p>
			<p class="parahs">Lets start from the begining... The <span class="spanpone">"Big Bang"</span>
			event is a physical theory ( yes it is actually not a fact )<br>
			that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.<br><BR>
			Cientists best estimate is that the Big Bang ocured 13.8 billion years oago.
			But, like so many of the largest-scale properties of the universe, we are not entirely sure about its age.</p><br>
			
			<h1 style="background-image: url('img2/wall.jpg');" class="header2"><br>
			<p>Fact 2<br>Space in comletely silent</p>
			<p class="parahs">First an explanation what sound is,
			sound is a vibration acting like a wave moving through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid,
			<br>that is how we comunicate with eachover, the sound wave moving through air.
			<br><br>
			There is no atmosphere in space or any matirial, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard.<br>
			So hear me out StarWars fans, yes the Galactic Empire spaceship sound effect is not real ;)</p><br>
			
			<h1 style="background-image: url('img2/wall2.jpg');" class="header2"><br> <!-- השורה הזו היא בשביל לעשים את התמונה ברקע -->
			<p>Fact 3<br>Not that many as you think</p>
			<p class="parahs">Most of us heard already about our own galaxy the Milky Way,
			We heard how big and vast she is, and contain millions stars,<br>
			But did you know that there are more <span class="toobright">trees on earth</span> than stars in the Milky Way?<br>
			There are about three trillion trees on <span class="toobright">planet earth</span>, and between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in the galaxy.</p>
			
			<h1 style="background-image: url('img2/wall3.jpg');" class="header2"><br> <!-- השורה הזו היא בשביל לעשים את התמונה ברקע -->
			<p>Fact 4<br>Supermassive black holes</p>
			<p class="parahs">You heard it right, if a regular black hole wasnt scary enough
			then there are giant black holes in the ceneter of most galaxies, And they are million time heavier then a regular one.<br>
			Their enormuos gravity field is what shapes the galaxy<br><br>
			We are not certain how they became so big, but we know they started in the early times of the univers from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIKXvDlf8_0" target="_blank">super nova*</a>
			like a normal size balck hole, they grew bigger the more they "ate".<br>
			
			<h1 style="background-image: url('img2/wall4.jpg');" class="header2"><br> <!-- השורה הזו היא בשביל לעשים את התמונה ברקע -->
			<p>Fact 5<br>Not all is gravity</p>
			<p class="parahs">As we learned before the univers was born in a Bang, and began to expand to what we know today.<br>
			But when you think about it, gravity sepose to pull things in and not pusing out out, so the univers must be shriking right?<br>
			No, in 1998 we found out that the expansion of the univers is actually speeding up.<br>
			The reasson for this is what we call <a class="atwo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ" target="_blank">dark energy/ matter*</a>
			which has properties of pushing instead of pulling.<br>
			If this cointinues, scientists predict that the univers will tear apart, but that will take billions of years.
