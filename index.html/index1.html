			<a class="backhome" href="index.html"><span><img src="../img2/flyhome.png"></span></a><br><br>
			<p class="parahone">Explore the wonders of space through scientific and historical facts about galaxies, planets, and cosmic entities,<br>
			Brace yourself for an exhilarating journey, <br><br>
			where the absence of seatbelts is the very essence of fun in zero gravity.</p><br>
			
			<p>Fact 1<br>It is just a theory!</p>
			<p class="parahs">Let us start from the beginning... The <span class="spanpone">"Big Bang"</span>
			event is a physical theory ( yes it is actually not a fact )<br>
			that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.<br><BR>
			Scientists' best estimate is that the Big Bang occurred 13.8 billion years ago.
			But, like so many of the largest-scale properties of the universe, we are not entirely sure about its age.</p><br>
			
			<h1 style="background-image: url('../img2/wall.jpg');" class="header2"><br>
			<p>Fact 2<br>Space is completely silent</p>
			<p class="parahs">First an explanation of what sound is,
			sound is a vibration acting like a wave moving through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid,
			<br> That is how we communicate with each other, the sound wave moving through the air.
			<br><br>
			There is no atmosphere in space or any material, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard.<br>
			So hear me out StarWars fans, yes the Galactic Empire spaceship sound effect is not real ;)</p><br>
			
			<h1 style="background-image: url('../img2/wall2.jpg');" class="header2"><br> <!-- השורה הזו היא בשביל לעשים את התמונה ברקע -->
			<p>Fact 3<br>Not that many as you think</p>
			<p class="parahs">Most of us heard already about our galaxy the Milky Way,
			We heard how vast she is, and contain millions of stars,<br>
			But did you know that there are more <span class="toobright">trees on Earth</span> than stars in the Milky Way?<br>
			There are about three trillion trees on <span class="toobright">planet Earth </span>, and between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in the galaxy.</p>
			
			<h1 style="background-image: url('../img2/wall3.jpg');" class="header2"><br> <!-- השורה הזו היא בשביל לעשים את התמונה ברקע -->
			<p>Fact 4<br>Supermassive black holes</p>
			<p class="parahs">You heard it right, if a regular black hole wasn't scary enough
			then there are giant black holes in the center of most galaxies, And they are a million times heavier than a regular one.<br>
			Their enormous gravity field is what shapes the galaxy<br><br>
			We are not certain how they became so big, but we know they started in the early times of the universe from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIKXvDlf8_0" target="_blank">supernova*</a>
			like a normal size black hole, they grew bigger the more they "ate".<br>
			
			<h1 style="background-image: url('../img2/wall4.jpg');" class="header2"><br> <!-- השורה הזו היא בשביל לעשים את התמונה ברקע -->
			<p>Fact 5<br>Not all is gravity</p>
			<p class="parahs">As we learned before the universe was born with a Bang, and began to expand to what we know today.<br>
			But when you think about it, gravity is supposed to pull things in instead of pushing them out, Therefore the universe is probably shrinking, right? <br>
			No, in 1998 we found out that the expansion of the universe is speeding up.<br>
			The reason for this is what we call <a class="atwo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ" target="_blank">dark energy/ matter*</a>
			which has properties of pushing instead of pulling.<br>
			If this continues, scientists predict that the universe will tear apart, but that will take billions of years.
